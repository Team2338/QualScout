## What is QualScout? 
QualScout is a spinoff of our other scouting app, [GearScout](https://github.com/Team2338/GearScout2024), and is designed to be used in tandem with it. Unlike GearScout, however,  QualScout collects qualitative data, all stored in the same server as GearScout, allowing for seamless access to both types of information. 


## What do I need to use it?
All you need is a device that can connect to the internet! You do **NOT** need a steady internet connection, but you do need it to submit information.

## How do I access and use the app?
You can access QualScout [here](https://qual.gearitforward.com/). A full tutorial on how to use the app is published [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ktJ9sY4cItUND7cP-sToWUVwU_pONIC9Bmkj8yvJlj8/edit#slide=id.g2b62d68ee77_0_288).
